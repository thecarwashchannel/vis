#vis

vis is a visualizer for music files. It is written in pure javascript, using a bit of jQuery just for comfort. It is inspired by the [Monstercat Visualizer](http://youtube.com/Monstercat).

It is merely a boilerplate. Feel free to use it in your projects, but credit me please.

vis is maintained by me, [@ix](http://github.com/ix).

I edited this to use asdfmovie song.
